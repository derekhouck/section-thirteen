_[PRLog](http://www.prlog.org/12480983-superfan-to-premiere-at-action-on-film-international-film-festival.html)_ – **_Aug. 10, 2015_ – _LOS ANGELES_ —** Section Thirteen announced today that “Superfan”<wbr></wbr> will have its world premiere at the 11th Annual Action on Film International Film Festival. The 2015 AOF Fest will run September 18 – 27 in the city of Monrovia, Calif.

“Superfan”<wbr></wbr> stars Aryiel Hartman (“Harry Potter and the Ten Years Later,” “Water for Elephants”) as SIREN92, a seductive cam girl, and Derek Houck (“Community,”<wbr></wbr> “United States of Tara”) as Sam, a lonely man who pays $3.99 a minute to talk to the most beautiful woman he’s ever seen. The short is directed by Zack Scott (“The 28th Day: The Wrath of Steph,” “Little Magdeline”).

“Rashida Jones has really shined a light on reexamining the porn industry with the popular documentary ‘Hot Girls Wanted,’ and we’re excited for Aryiel’s performance in ‘Superfan’<wbr></wbr> to take audiences even a step further out of their comfort zone,” Scott said. “The world has changed dramatically in the past 10 years as digital technology continues to advance, and it’s important that we take an honest look at not just the performers but the people who essentially pay for sex without ever leaving their homes.”

“Superfan”<wbr></wbr> was written by Houck and is a production of Section Thirteen in association with 8-Track Productions.

“This is my second project to appear at AOF, and to return to the festival and give them the world premiere is gratifying,”<wbr></wbr> said Houck whose web series “Napoleon Bon Appétit” was an official selection at the festival in 2011.
