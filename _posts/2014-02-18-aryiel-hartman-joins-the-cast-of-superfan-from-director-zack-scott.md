_[PRLog (Press Release)](http://www.prlog.org/12283783-aryiel-hartman-joins-the-cast-of-superfan-from-director-zack-scott.html)_ – **_Feb. 18, 2014_ – _LOS ANGELES, Calif._ —** Section Thirteen announced today that Aryiel Hartman (“Harry Potter and the Ten Years Later,” “Water for Elephants”) has been set to star as the cam-girl SIREN92 in the upcoming Zack Scott short film “Superfan.”

“SIREN92 is a complicated and sophisticated woman that requires someone who can command the screen,” Scott said. “She must be not only seductive and manipulative, but vulnerable as well. Aryiel’s background as a singer and burlesque artist are a perfect fit for SIREN92, and it is an honor to have her take on this role.”

Hartman will star opposite Derek Houck (“Community,” “United States of Tara”) as Sam, a lonely man who pays for a private session with SIREN92.

“I’m really excited to dive deep into this character and find more and more moments that separate her from just your average sex worker,” Hartman said. “She’s very unique and I can’t wait to get to know her better.”

“Superfan” was written by Houck. Section Thirteen is producing, in association with 8-Track Productions.

Hartman is represented by 3G Management.
