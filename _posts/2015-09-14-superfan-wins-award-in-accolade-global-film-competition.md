**LOS ANGELES, September 14, 2015** – *[PRLog](http://www.prlog.org/12492753-superfan-wins-award-in-accolade-global-film-competition.html)* — Zack Scott (“The 28th Day: The Wrath of Steph,” “Little Magdeline”) has won a prestigious Award of Recognition from *The Accolade Global Film Competition*. The award was given for Scott’s exciting film short, “Superfan,” which stars Aryiel Hartman (“Harry Potter and the Ten Years Later,” “Water for Elephants”) as SIREN92, a seductive cam girl, and Derek Houck (“Community,” “United States of Tara”) as Sam, a lonely man who pays $3.99 a minute to talk to the most beautiful woman he’s ever seen.

“This award recognizes how poignant the world of adult entertainment and camming is right now,” Scott said. “With popular documentaries like ‘Hot Girls Wanted’ by Rashida Jones shining a light on the adult film industry, we’re excited for ‘Superfan’ to take audiences even a step further out of their comfort zone.”

*The Accolade* recognizes film, television, videography and new media professionals who demonstrate exceptional achievement in craft and creativity, and those who produce standout entertainment or contribute to profound social change. Entries are judged by highly qualified professionals in the film and television industry. Information about the *Accolade* and a list of recent winners can be found at [www.accoladecompetition.org](http://www.accoladecompetition.org).

In winning an *Accolade*, “Superfan” joins the ranks of other high-profile winners of this internationally respected award including the Oscar winning production of “The Lady in Number Six” by Malcolm Clarke, the very talented Dave Bossert of Disney for his short documentary, “The Tunes Behind The Toons,” Hollywood industry veteran Ron Howard for “When You Find Me” and Highwire Films Australia for their popular *ABC* TV series “twentysomething.” Rick Prickett, who chairs *The Accolade Global Film Competition*, had this to say about the latest winners, “*The Accolade* is not an easy award to win. Entries are received from around the world from powerhouse companies to remarkable new talent. *The Accolade* helps set the standard for craft and creativity. The judges were pleased with the exceptional high quality of entries. The goal of *The Accolade* is to help winners achieve the recognition they deserve.”
